Solving the 0-1 knapsack problem using simulated annealing

Simulated annealing is a technique that approximates the global optimum of a
given function by relying heavily on probabilities and randomization. This technique
derives inspiration from the behavior of solids when they are subject to controlled
cooling.

The challenge presented by the knapsack problem is
that given a set of different items, each with an associated weight and value, determine
which items should be picked in order to maximize the value of the items
without surpassing the weight capacity of the knapsack.

To run the program wait for the twenty runs then click the "check" button. 
To see other test cases, uncomment a set of weights, values and 
weight_capacity_of_knapsack in the code.
